  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (N e 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilib-rium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

@Article{Meuwissen1997,
  abstract = {In a breeding scheme, the aim is high rates of genetic gain with limited inbreeding. A dynamic selection rule is developed that maximizes selection response in populations with overlapping generations. The rule maximizes the genetic merit of selected animals while limiting the average relationship of the population after the current round of selection. The latter is shown to limit the contribution of the current population to the future inbreeding. The rule accounts for the selection of some candidates during previous selection rounds and for the expected future contributions of the selection candidates. Inputs for the rule are the BLUP breeding values and ages of selection candidates, the relationship matrix of all animals, and contributions of animals during previous selection rounds. Output is the optimal number of offspring for each candidate. Computer simulations of dairy cattle nucleus schemes showed that predefined rates of inbreeding were actually achieved, without compromising long-term selection response, at least up to 20 yr of selection. At the same rates of inbreeding, the dynamic selection rule obtained up to 44{\%} more genetic gain than direct selection for BLUP breeding values. The advantage of the dynamic rule over BLUP selection decreased with increasing population sizes and with greater predefined rates of inbreeding. Consequently, the dynamic rule should be especially useful in small selection schemes in which relatively low rates of inbreeding are desired.},

General elements of Bayesian inference, e.g., prior and posterior distributions, informative vs noninformative priors, likelihood functions, finite samples, “memory” properties and integration of nuisance parameters are illustrated with animal breeding examples. Shrinkage estimators are discussed from a Bayesian viewpoint. A general framework for estimation of breeding value with or without selection or assortative mating, including the situation where variances and covariances are unknown, is presented. Selection indexes, best linear unbiased prediction, nonlinear merit functions, nonlinear models and estimation of genetic parameters are discussed from a Bayesian perspective.},

@Article{Bulmer1971,
  abstract = {If a metric character is determined by an effectively infinite number of loci, selection cannot cause any permanent change in the genetic variance but will cause a temporary change which is rapidly reversed when selection ceases. This change is due entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases, the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its original value. An expression is derived for the predicted amount of change in the genetic variance due to disequilibrium in the absence of linkage. The change is likely to be small under selection intensities found under natural conditions, but it may be appreciable under intense artificial selection. This limiting result shows that the magnitude of any permanent change in the variance due to selection must decrease as the number of loci involved increases and that, when the number of loci is large, it is likely to be much less than the temporary change due to disequilibrium.
